# Final-Project-CP468
# Formula 1 Podium Prediction
Project using machine learning to predict the outcome of Formula 1 races.
### Objective
Be able to predict the outcome of Formula 1 races, mainly focusing on accuracy of predicting podium positions.
### Results
model
linear_regression            0.500000
neural_network_classifier    0.636364
nn_regressor                 0.681818

### Conclusions
We were able to achive a 70% accurate model for the 2021 season of Formula 1 using a Neural Network Regressor.

## Data Set
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020

## Install and Usage Guide
Please make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed on your system.
Run the "setup.ipynb" file to install all the packages below:
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- folium

## Performance Parameters
Performance was measured based on the percentage of correct race winners the model acould predict in the 2021 season. Refer to the following formula: correct_predictions / total_races = performance.
